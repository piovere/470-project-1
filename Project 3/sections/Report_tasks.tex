Dory Miller:

In this project I worked on the derivations and putting together the report.  Lee and I would compare answers after working separately on the derivations and work through any differences.  I also took the results and transformed them into a format that would be easier to implement in the code.   I assisted in debugging the code. I also put together the Introduction and Methodology in the report and presentation and provided additional graphics.
