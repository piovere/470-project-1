	We provide an analysis of a simplified two and four-group, one-dimensional neutron diffusion two regions of different composition. The parameters chosen such that the two regions best reflect a fuel pellet surrounded by a moderator. As expected, our model produces an increase in the neutron flux of the non-fast populations near the boundary of the two regions. A decrease in the fast population was also seen in a similar region, relating the scattering of neutrons from the fast group to slower ones.

	However, while our code converge to a relatively constant width were the core was critical, the value was much smaller than expected and was not consistent enough to be confident in those results. The various approaches to this problem produced similar but slightly different operating matrices, implying that careful choice of methodology is necessary in solving similar problems. 
	While not fully-functioning, our code is capable of not only computing flux profiles for 2 and 4 group but $N$ group. A one needs to only input the appropriate constants for each group and the code will solve for the flux profiles. Also it can handle nondirectly couple down scattering and upscattering.
