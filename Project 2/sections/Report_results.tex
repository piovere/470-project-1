A Fortran program was developed to implement the discrete solution to the transport equation. The source code is included as an attachment to this report. An initial guess of k and b is used to calculate a better value, which is then redefined in the code and iterated until a reasonable error is reached.

In addition to this, the program also finds at what width the a material with the specific $\Sigma_f$ and $\Sigma_a$ is critical. It acheives this by nesting the loop described above into another which test if $k = 1 \pm error margin$ and slightly changes the width accordingly until $k$ converges to that value. Our numerical calcuation of the given parameters gave a critical width of 
5.14 centimeters.
