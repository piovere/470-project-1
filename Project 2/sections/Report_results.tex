A Fortran program was developed to implement the discrete solution to the transport equation. The source code is included as an attachment to this report. 

The program allowed an analysis of a one-dimensional core filled with a multiplying medium. The flux distribution was solved for by iteratively seeking out eigenvalues of the material matrix.
