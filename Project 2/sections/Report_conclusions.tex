	We provide an analysis of a simplified one-group, one-dimensional neutron diffusion in a multiplying medium. The various approaches to this problem produced similar but slightly different solutions, implying that careful choice of methodology is necessary in solving similar problems. 

	It is worth noting that the nature of numerical computation leaves even experienced programmers vulnerable to the idiosyncracies of computers and programming languages. Difficult-to-debug implicit casting of variables plagued the software used to perform the calculations, which were found only once the results were compared with a well-understood analytic solution. New programs designed to simulate systems that resist such analytic analysis will not have such safeguards, necessitating additional care.
