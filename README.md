# 470-project-1

## To Do ##
- [ ] Normalize flux vector in project 2
- [ ] Node-by-node checking of flux convergence
- [ ] Show to Chvala again
- [x] Implement pseudocode (JR, 10/12)
- [x] Are the corner terms for the A matrix correct? (class, 10/13)
- [x] Is the iteration for k correct? (class, 10/13)
- [x] Subroutines yayyyyyyyyy (JR, 10/12)
- [x] Reflector? (someday)
- [x] Report. (10/28)
- [x] F (matrix) vs. scalar values (class, 10/13)



 # Note:
 I've cleaned up the code that was in the desperate.f90 and put it in desperatev2.f90 (Still trying to think of a better name). Some problems with the code(Andrew, 10/24):

- I had to avoid the subrountines because I don't think I pushed them from psudeocode to actual code properly. The issues was pushing vectors vs. variables through the subroutines
- Only for the slab geometry but I think that would be an easy addition to the code once we have them
- The solution doesn't stop working for small slab widths
