# 470-project-1

## To Do ##
- Implement pseudocode (JR, 10/12)
- Are the corner terms for the A matrix correct? (class, 10/13)
- Is the iteration for k correct? (class, 10/13)
- Subroutines yayyyyyyyyy (JR, 10/12)
- Reflector? (someday)
- Report. (10/28)
- F (matrix) vs. scalar values (class, 10/13)



 # Note:
 I've cleaned up the code that was in the desperate.f90 and put it in desperatev2.f90 (Still trying to think of a better name). Some problems with the code(Andrew, 10/18):

- It does output a bunch of warnings about type mismatch in the subroutines but it still makes an executable
- The matrix elements are still the elements from the original code so we probably need to fix those
- Only for the slab geometry but I think that would be an easy addition to the code once we have them
