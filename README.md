# 470-project-1

## To Do ##
- [ ] Normalize flux vector in project 2
- [ ] Node-by-node checking of flux convergence
- [ ] Show to Chvala again
- [x] Implement pseudocode (JR, 10/12)
- [x] Are the corner terms for the A matrix correct? (class, 10/13)
- [x] Is the iteration for k correct? (class, 10/13)
- [x] Subroutines yayyyyyyyyy (JR, 10/12)
- [x] Reflector? (someday)
- [x] Report. (10/28)
- [x] F (matrix) vs. scalar values (class, 10/13)



 # Note:
Current Issues with christmas (11/20 Andrew)
- The adjustments for k_old->k is not working (which also prevents criticallty search from executing
- Output file is only one(?) of the flux groups (Its all NaN's anyway so maybe this will go away)
- Still need to put in new matrix and matrix declaration subroutine
- That tinsle stuff gets everywhere
