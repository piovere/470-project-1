# 470-project-1

## To Do ##
- Derive solution for source f*S at x=W
- Input into program
- Generate graphs for source at x=W
- Include derivations for solution in other coordinate systems
- Update python program to account for other coordinate systems
- Graphs of other coordinate systems results? Should they be any different?
- Plot many different N values on the same graph...log scale
