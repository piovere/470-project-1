# 470-project-1

## To Do ##
- [ ] Implement real math version of eigenvalue/eigenvector convergence
- [ ] Correct math in Project 2 report to look for $\tilde{a}$ not w
- [ ] Update graphs to show new critical width (~154cm)
- [x] Normalize flux vector in project 2
- [x] Node-by-node checking of flux convergence
- [x] Show to Chvala again
- [x] Implement pseudocode (JR, 10/12)
- [x] Are the corner terms for the A matrix correct? (class, 10/13)
- [x] Is the iteration for k correct? (class, 10/13)
- [x] Subroutines yayyyyyyyyy (JR, 10/12)
- [x] Reflector? (someday)
- [x] Report. (10/28)
- [x] F (matrix) vs. scalar values (class, 10/13)



 # Note:
Current Issues with christmas (11/22 Andrew)
- Still need to put in new matrix and matrix declaration subroutine
- I think if the matrix is put in properly then things will work out
- Hopefully fix up the flux output
- That tinsle stuff gets everywhere
